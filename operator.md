## AWS Elasticache Memcached

AWS ElastiCache for Memcached is a managed in-memory caching service. It provides a fully-managed, in-memory data store environment, compatible with Memcached, which enables quick data retrieval to support high-performance applications and reduce the load on your primary data store.

### Design Decisions
- **High Availability**: This design ensures that there is a replication mechanism in place to maintain service continuity.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale your Memcached clusters to meet changing application demands.
- **Security**: VPC support and security group configurations to ensure that your Memcached instances are secure.
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch monitoring to keep track of the cache performance and activities.
- **Automatic Backups**: Although Memcached does not inherently support persistent storage, integration with other AWS services can be designed to handle data backup.

### Runbook

#### Diagnosing Connectivity Issues

If your application is unable to connect to the Memcached cluster, ensure the following:

1. The security group attached to the Memcached nodes allows traffic from the app instances.
2. The VPC and subnet configurations are correct and both the client and server are within the same VPC.

**AWS CLI Command to check the security group rules:**

```sh
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-1234567890abcdef0
```

**Expected Output:**

Ensure the inbound rules allow traffic on the Memcached port (typically 11211) from the source IP addresses of your application instances.

#### Checking Cache Node Status

If the Memcached cluster is not performing as expected, you might want to check the status of the nodes in the cluster.

**AWS CLI Command to describe cache clusters:**

```sh
aws elasticache describe-cache-clusters --cache-cluster-id your-cluster-id --show-cache-node-info
```

**Expected Output:**

Look for the status of cache nodes; they should have a status of "available" to be operational.

#### High Latency Issues

High latency can be caused by various factors, including high CPU usage or network issues. 

**AWS CLI Command to get CloudWatch metrics for CPU utilization:**

```sh
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/ElastiCache --metric-name CPUUtilization --dimensions Name=CacheClusterId,Value=your-cluster-id --start-time 2023-10-01T00:00:00Z --end-time 2023-10-02T00:00:00Z --period 3600 --statistics Average
```

**Expected Output:**

Check if the CPU utilization is abnormally high. Values consistently above 80% could indicate that the cache is under heavy load.

#### Checking Data Consistency and Load

Run Memcached commands to check for key distribution and hit/miss ratios, which might indicate issues with your caching strategy.

**Telnet into your Memcached Node:**

```sh
telnet your-memcached-endpoint 11211
```

**Run Memcached Commands:**

```sh
stats
```

**Expected Output:**

This will display a series of statistics. Check for the number of cache hits, misses, and the cache item's distribution over the nodes. High miss rates could indicate that your data isn't effectively being cached.

#### Flushing the Cache

Sometimes, stale data might cause issues, and you may need to flush the cache.

**Telnet into your Memcached Node and run the flush_all command:**

```sh
telnet your-memcached-endpoint 11211
flush_all
```

This will clear all the data stored in your Memcached cluster. Note that this should be done with caution as it may result in increased load on your primary database until the cache is repopulated.
